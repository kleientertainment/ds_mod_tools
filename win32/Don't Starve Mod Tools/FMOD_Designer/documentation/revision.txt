  remembered in the recent file list

  point in each sound and give your parameter a very large velocity and you can
  effectively sequence oneshot sounds together. Great for random dialog!

- Fixed error when building MP2/MP3 with waveform quality < 10


05/10/07 1.09.04

  automatically updated with the angle to the event about the listener's up
  vector (-180 to 180 degrees)
+ Added a "3D Position randomization" property to sound definitions; sound
  definition instances are offset from their parent event by a random vector
  based on this value, recalculated each time the sound is triggered
